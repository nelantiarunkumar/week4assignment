Overview:

A Python-based programme called the Contact Management System is used to handle contacts. Users may make and edit connections, including general contacts and targeted student contacts. This system provides as an illustration of Python's support for object-oriented programming (OOP) ideas and inheritance.


Features:
1. Contact Class
The Contact class is the parent class, representing basic contacts.
It includes methods to get and set the contact's name and email.
2. StudentContact Class
The StudentContact class is a subclass of Contact, designed for student contacts.
It extends the Contact class and includes additional attributes such as major, career interest, and the number of courses.
Methods are provided to get and set these attributes.


How to use:
1. Run the program: python contact_management.py
2. Enter the contact's name and email.
3. Optionally, create a StudentContact by providing major, career interest, and the number of courses.
4. Update contact information as needed.
