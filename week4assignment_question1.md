Explanation

To extract key-value pairs from a nested dictionary, use the Python script extract_key_value_pairs.py that is available in this repository. The script offers a flexible way of traversing through intricate nested dictionaries and extracting all key-value combinations, which can be helpful for a variety of data processing jobs.


How to use:

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the function in your python code.
3. Create a dictionary containing the data you want to extract key-value pairs.
4. Call the extract_key_value_pairs function with your dictionary as an argument.
5. keyValuePairs will now contain all key-value pairs from your dictionary, including those within nested dictionaries.
